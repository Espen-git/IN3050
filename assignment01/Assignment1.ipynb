    "Implement a hybrid algorithm to solve the TSP: Couple your GA and hill climber by running the hill climber a number of iterations on each individual in the population as part of the evaluation. Test both Lamarckian and Baldwinian learning models and report the results of both variants in the same way as with the pure GA (min,\n",
    "max, mean and standard deviation of the end result and an averaged generational plot). How do the results compare to that of the pure GA, considering the number of evaluations done?"
